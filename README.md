# About me 
Hello! My name is Elaine, I'm an ICU nurse and currently studying for my Master's in CS at Seattle University. I attended Code Fellows bootcamp to learn more about web development and gained experience building full-stack projects. I love building interactive and robust applications and I have a passion for front-end technology! This year, I am excited to learn about machine learning and continue to build on my foundations of distributed systems! I'm currently looking for software engineer internships & entry level roles!
