  "overview": "Hi there! My name is Elaine, I'm based in Seattle, Washington üå≤. A few months ago, I graduated from Code Fellows, a Full-Stack Web Developmet bootcamp where I learned how to build robust user applications using MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, & Node.js) stack. My interests in software engineering have only grown since finishing my bootcamp which led me to pursue a Master's of Computer Science Degree at Seattle University ü¶Ö. As I continue to solidify my fundamentals in computer science, I am finding new interests through learning more about distributed systems, machine learning and interactive designs to create unique user-experiences! I love building personal projects and seeking new challenges. Let's work together and make your ideas become a reality! ü™ê",
  "projects": "These projects showcase my skills & experience through examples of my own passion projects and side projects I have build for others around me! I have included some creative projects that I've collaborated on with other students and aspiring software engineers. These projects reflect my learning progress since starting my journey to becoming a proffesional software engineer!
